I'm a recent graduate in [Mathematical and Theoretical Physics](http://mmathphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/) from Oxford University. 
Moving on from this, I'm pleased to have begun my career as a software developer by interning at [Softwire West](www.softwire.com) 
(soon to be [Ghyston](www.ghyston.com)). When not working I'm usually out and about Climbing, Running, Cycling, Skiing, Mountaineering...
 
I love learning new things and am always up for a challenge, If you think you've got one for me then don't hesitate to 
get in contact!

I'm a recent graduate in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics from Oxford University. I'm pleased to have begun 
my career as a software developer at [Softwire West](www.softwire.com) (soon to be [Ghyston](www.ghyston.com)).
When not working I try to always be out an about Climbing, Running, Cycling, Skiing, Mountaineering, and so on..! 
I love learning new things and am always up for a challenge, If you think you've got one for me then don't hesitate to 
get in contact!.
